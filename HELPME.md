reading and you will be ready to start filming toilets! (For the good of the
NUS community of course!)


## Creating a submission

1. Sign in to your Google account.
 * Enjoy the toilet quotes if that is your thing :)
2. Enter name of the toilet in the "Name" field.
 * Toilet name should be something descriptive and unique. Examples can be
  seen from the main Let It Go app.
3. For Latitude and Longtitude of toilet, click on the emded map and the
coordinates of the clicked point will be automatically filled in the fields.
 * Alternatively, if you have allowed location permissions for this site, you
  can click on the "Set lat lon to current location button" and the fields will
  be filled with your position's coordinates.
 * To verify that your location is accurate, click on the button with the
  target icon in the map and the map will pan to your location. Note that if
  location services are not enabled, your location will be shown as the middle
  of NUS and the "Set lat lon to current location" button will do nothing.
4. Proceed to check the facilities present in the toilet.
5. Select a panorama image to upload for your submission. Panoramas should be
< 5 megabytes and should be 180 degree photos. Panoramas should include the
toilet entrances and as much of the surroundings as possible, so as to facilitate
identification and navigation.
 * Example of 180 degree photograph:
  ![Panorama](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nelsontky/let-it-go/master/assets/paranomas/computing/COM1%20Level%202%20Student%20Area.jpg)
 * Panorama will be embed into a panorama viewer, making it look sick and slick :sunglasses:

 * Our panoramas were all taken with Panorama360 ([Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vtcreator.android360) | [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/360-panorama/id377342622))
 * You can use any camera application you want but **make sure panoramas are *180 degrees*!**
6. Click on submit button, wait for the upload and you are done!
 * Submission button will be greyed out if image choosen is invalid or Name/Lat/Lon fields are empty.
